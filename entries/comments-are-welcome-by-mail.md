A comment section is an expected feature of modern website and it is hard to
find a page which does not contain a form to post a comment. I, however, will
not include a commenting form into my blog and I will explain my reasoning
in a defensive fashion with this entry.

# This blog is static

My blog being static implies that I cannot just write some code and pull a
switch to make a text field magically appear on the page.

Countering this demands a yet another post, but it mostly can be summed to
following points[^list]:

1. Data does not belong to me;
2. I have never had a pleasant experience posting a comment with commenting
   platform;
3. Their comment boxes do too much and JavaScript is way too fat.

[^list]: Not exhaustive, ordered by descending severity

# Comment boxes are spammed constantly

There of course are ways to prevent spam appearing on your pages like
moderating every comment or verifying every comment with [Akismet][akismet]
and moderating those that did not pass. So making sure no spam comments get
into your pages involves some manual work, which I would like to avoid as
much as possible.

In my previous blog I secured my comment box with a combination of
[Akismet][akismet] and [reCaptcha][recaptcha]. If Akismet deemed comment wrong
a commenter got to solve a captcha. Although solution worked flawlessly I
would rather spend my time writing more technically involving code.

> But commenting platforms take care of that!

… by making you to submit them your whole CV! Also points stated above still
apply.

# Responses do not reach involved people

Insightful and quality comments posted by visitors often demands for answer.
Sadly the poster rarely comes back to check if there is an answer and
discussion fades out before starting. Some commenting systems offer
functionality to get notified via e-mail when there is a response but who
actually takes advantage of it?

# Comments are welcome by mail

Therefore, after evaluating all the demerits, I will not put a comment box
into my blog and offer you to comment on my posts by writing an e-mail.

A summary of reasons follow:

1. I can respond to e-mails and probability they will be read is much higher;
2. You don't have to submit your personal data if you do not want. If you do
   not need a response you might as well send an e-mail from anonymous box;
3. E-Mail service providers already provide protection from spam;
4. I and you get to not use commenting platforms!

P.S. You can also comment by posting in social network both of us frequent.

A comment section is an expected feature of a modern web site and it is hard
to find a page which does not contain a form to post a comment. I, however,
will not include a commenting form into my blog and my reasoning, in a
defensive fashion, as well as solutions are stated in this entry.

# This blog is static

Blog being static implies that blogger cannot just pull a switch to make a text
field magically appear on the page. Disregarding that, a static web site has
its own perks and I deem dynamism to be not necessary for a casual blog.

<q>But there is so much commenting platforms out there! Why don't you use
this, that or whatnot?</q>
– most readers would ask now. Countering this question demands a yet another
post, but it mostly can be summed to following points:

1. Data does not belong to me;
2. I have never had a pleasant experience posting a comment with any
   commenting platform;
3. Their text areas do too much and JavaScript is way too fat.

# Spam prevention is too hard

Ways to prevent spam appearing on web pages include moderating every comment
or moderating only those a service like [Akismet][akismet] marks as a spam.
Some combinations of such services are possible as well… For example in my
previous blog I managed my comments with a combination of Akismet and
[reCaptcha][recaptcha]. If Akismet deemed comment wrong, system presented
a captcha to solve – solution worked pretty well overall. Either way making
sure no spam gets into your web pages involves some manual work, which I
would like to avoid as much as possible.

Sure, commenting platforms might take care of that, but their methods still
have some limits and spam is bound to make its way through into the database.

# Blogs aren't suited for discussion

In my RSS feed I found [one of my reasons expressed so well][citation-source],
I am going to even cite it:

> There is a reason why blog posts and comments don’t create the discourse we
> are used from forums: In forums the initial post is just a spark and all
> subsequent posts are presented as equals. After a while there is little
> that sets the initial post apart from following posts.
>
> It’s very different with blog posts. The blog post itself almost always
> dominates the whole discussion, comments are visually set apart and often
> set in smaller font sizes. Following up on previous comments is awkward, so
> most comments are focused on the initial blog post, which means the
> discussion doesn’t go anywhere.

In a rare case an insightful comment generates some discussion and a
commentator actually gets involved in it… I would consider myself lucky, but
I am yet to get one of those insightful ones.

# Comments are welcome by mail

Therefore, after evaluating all the alternatives, I will not put a comment box
into my blog and offer you to comment on my posts by writing an e-mail instead.
I respond to e-mails anyway and probability my answers will be read is much
higher. Also I will not have to manage spam as well as get to not use a
commenting platform I dislike so much.

**P.S.** Comments are also accepted in social networks I frequent.

title: Renewable energy is not renewable

Sometimes I find it hard to understand why people call some things
misleadingly. For example it is widely accepted to label energy made from
sunlight, wind, geothermal heat or waves as renewable energy, but as soon
as you look at bigger picture it is not so renewable after all, thus
misleading.

# The sun

The sun, like any other star, “burns” hydrogen into helium emitting huge
amounts of the energy in the process. From human standpoint it would not be
so wrong saying the Sun is an inexhaustible source of energy, more so with our
energy needs today, but whichever way I look I cannot confirm that the Sun is
renewable. Splitting nucleus of helium into two hydrogen nuclei, which would
make the sun a renewable energy source, would just increase entropy
further – that is shifting the problem elsewhere.

So the sun is as exhaustible as fossil fuels are and it is called renewable.
Of course it is not, there's just much more of it.

# Wind and waves

It is hard to envision wind or waves running out. Surely we will never run out
of them, right? Well, no! They are a result of activity of some bigger
energy source like the Sun and other celestial bodies.

Winds of various kind and strength kindly provides us waves some nations exploit
making energy. Similarly winds are sponsored by the sun. And the sun as pointed
out earlier is not renewable at all, therefore winds and waves has no right to
be called renewable too.

# Geothermal energy

Now the geothermal energy is a bit different. The energy called geothermal
could as well be called thermonuclear – decay of radioactive elements, most
notably thorium, heats the core of the Earth and some nations heat their water
by pumping it into the earth. If people are smart enough to think of nuclear
power as of exhaustible energy source, why it is not a case for geothermal
energy as well?

# Not renewable, never was and will never be

Please stop misleading people into believing there exists a better,
inexhaustible source of power with your incorrect terminology. It is a cause of
horrible energy politics and leads to common people believing utter non-sense
concerned 3rd parties spread.

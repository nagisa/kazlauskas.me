        <p>
        I prefer to be contacted via
        <a id="email-link">e-mail</a><noscript>(enable JavaScript to see a
        link)</noscript>, especially, if you have questions, suggestions,
        comments (especially in response to essays), job offers et cetera.

        <p>
        Please use following PGP key when contacting me, unless the matter
        is unquestionably trivial. How unencrypted non-trivial content is dealt
        with is up to myself. If you expect non-trivial response don’t forget
        to send your public key as well.

        <h2>Phone</h2>
        <blockquote><p>I heard you don’t use/have a phone, but could you tell
        me your phone number anyway?</p></blockquote>
        <p>
        Since a while ago I do carry a phone. It is internet-only so I can
        listen to music from my NAS while on move. This should explain why one
        ain’t getting such number.

        <h2>Social networks</h2>
        <p>I have accounts on following social networks in no specific order.
        Feel free to follow yours truly.</p>

        <p>I do <strong>not</strong> have an account on any other immensely
        popular social network, therefore if you happen to see somebody with
        my name (or nickname) there, bear in mind that might be another
        living creature.

    <h1>More about myself</h1>
    <p>Again: I’m Simonas Kazlauskas. <span id="age">18</span> years old libre,
    open source software activist from
    <a href="http://osm.org/go/0lP6yF2?layers=T&m="
    title="Where the hell is that‽" target="_blank">Vilnius, the capital of
    Lithuania</a>.</p>
    <p>I’m currently leisurely studying Computer Science and am employed.<p>

    <p>I maintain an interest in programming of all kinds and don’t shy away
    from unfamiliar problems. I’m proficient in Python, JavaScript and C,
    but prefer writing Haskell over everything. Even English.</p>
    <p>After programming in my fetish<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef"
    id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> list comes Japan and everything Japan.  On
    an almost unrelated note, I usually speak to myself in Japanese while
    cooking something containing soy or rice, but I still am incapable of such
    feat as reading kanji.</p>

    <p>Finally, the last mention-worthy thing is physics and chemistry. I
    usually indulge myself in theoretical part of those fields, but once in a
    while I get my hands dirty too. Luckily, I’m quick to abandon the
    experiment location, therefore my limbs are still firmly attached to the
    <del>controller</del>body.
    </p>

    <p>If you ever happen to invite me to lunch, you will appreciate knowing
    I’m a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovo-lacto_vegetarianism">
    ovo-lacto vegetarian</a> when sweets, pastries and other baked products
    are involved and <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacto_vegetarianism"> lacto
    vegetarian</a> otherwise.</p>

    <section id="about">
        <h1>Me and my work</h1>
        <p>I am Simonas Kazlauskas, a software developer from
        <a href="https://osm.org/go/0lP6yF2?m="
           title="Click for a map"
           target="_blank">Vilnius, Lithuania</a>.</p>

        <p>I believe in portable and reliable software that preserves the <a
        href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html"> four essential freedoms</a>. Most of
        the software I produce is cross-platform and oftentimes enables other developers to
        implement similarly portable solutions. See my profile at <a
        href="https://github.com/nagisa/">GitHub</a> for a non-exhaustive list of open-source
        projects I have created or contributed to.</p>

        <p>Besides the open-source projects, I have worked on a couple of web projects (spanning both
        backend and frontend), embedded projects and smart metering solutions. I am handy with a
        variety of programming languages: some as high-level as Haskell or Python and others as
        low-level as Assembly.</p>

        <p>I have had pleasure to work with a variety of less widespread ISAs such as MIPS,
        PowerPC, RISC-V, SPARC and even Z-seriesâ€™ s390x. That being said, ARM and x86 are the two I
        am most comfortable with.</p>

        <p>Most of my time, nowadays, is spent writing Rust and Nix for
        <a href="https://standard.ai/">Standard Cognition</a>.</p>

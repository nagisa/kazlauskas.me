<section id="interests-programming">

I love cracking various programming problems so much I even participate in
some programming competitions. I'm not partial to any specific field of
programming and I don't shy from unfamiliar challenges. Currently my “to go”
language is *Python*, still I like *JavaScript* quite a lot too. Writing
consistent, idiomatic *HTML* and *CSS* is yet another thing I do often. Lately
I have been producing some *C* (for competitions) and *Haskell*
(experimentation) code too.

Another thing I adore is a country called Japan, its culture and people.
Since childhood I was exposed to media about Japan quite often and
before I knew Japan, Japanese language, anime and various other things of
Japanese origin became a subset of the things I like a lot.

The last pair of interests that deserve a place in a front page are
physics and chemistry. As most of my understanding about the world is shaped
by those two, I explain myself my surroundings based on my knowledge of them.
My explorations tend to be theoretical rather than experimental though.

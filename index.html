    <p>I prefer hack&shy;ing with Py&shy;thon, still I like JavaS&shy;cript
    quite a lot too. Also I have ex&shy;per&shy;i&shy;ence in writ&shy;ing
    clean, idio&shy;matic HTML and CSS. When situ&shy;ation calls for it I can
    to some ex&shy;tent pro&shy;duce some C, Haskell or PHP too.
    </p>
    <p>If you are in&shy;ter&shy;ested in my code, it is avail&shy;able on
    <a href="https://github.com/simukis" target="_blank">github</a>.
